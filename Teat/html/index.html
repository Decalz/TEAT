	<h1>WELCOME</h1>
	<p>Ever thought about how much of a hassle it is to go out and buy stuff? Well suffer no more because we are here to serve your every whim. TEAT is made by lazy people for lazy people. I mean, a quick look at our website is all you need as proof that we legitimately don't do any work. Unless we are paid of course.</p>
	<h1>WHY DID WE DO THIS</h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Are you busy?</li>
			<li>Do you have better things to do?</li>
			<li>Is Kaufland too far away?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	Well consider yourself lucky because we go out of our way to make the world a better place to live in for sloths and couch potatoes.
	<h1>WHERE DO WE OPERATE</h1>
	<p>Currently, we do not operate at all for the sheer fact that this isn't even a business yet. Some dumb idiot got desperate for a senior project and that is basically it</p>
